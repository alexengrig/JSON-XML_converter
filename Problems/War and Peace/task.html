<p>When Anthony finally finished reading "War and Peace", he began to wonder how many words and how frequently were used
    in this book. Help Anthony and&nbsp;write a simplified version of a program that can count the words, separated by
    space and output the resulting statistics.</p>
<p>The program must read one line from the standard input and for each unique word in this line output the count of its
    repeated occurrence in the "word amount" format (see the output example). The words should be counted
    as&nbsp;<strong>case insensitive</strong>.</p>
<p>The order of words output may be arbitrary.</p>
<p>Each unique word must appear in the output only once.</p>
