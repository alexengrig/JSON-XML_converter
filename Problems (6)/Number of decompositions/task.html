<p>[ALERT-warning]This problem is a bit complicated and require some additional knowledge and googling. You can just
    skip it if you are a beginner or don't have enough time. But it is a good case to improve your problem solving and
    algorithmic skills.[/ALERT]</p>
<p>Read the integer <span class="math-tex">\( N \)</span> (<span class="math-tex">\( 1 \leq N \leq 40 \)</span>) from
    the standard input and list all the decompositions of NN into a sum of positive integers. The addends should go in
    non-ascending order within each decomposition.</p>
<p>Output all decompositions in the lexicographical order.</p>
<p>Please, use a recursive method to write your solution.</p>
