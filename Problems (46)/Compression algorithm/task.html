  <p>Upon learning that DNA is not a random string, freshmen of the Bioinformatics Institute from the informatics group suggested using a compression algorithm that compresses repeated characters in a string.</p> 
  <p>Encoding is performed as follows:<br> The string <strong>"aaaabbсaa"</strong> is converted into <strong>"a4b2с1a2"</strong>, that is, the groups of the same characters of the input string are replaced by the symbol and the number of its repetitions in this string.</p> 
  <p>Write a program, which reads the string, encodes it by this algorithm and outputs the encoded sequence. The encoding must be case sensitive.</p> 
  <p>Note, string can contain only a single character.</p>
