<p>The simplest spell checker is the one based on a list of known words. Every word in the text is being searched for in
    this list and, if such&nbsp;word was not found, it is marked as erroneous.</p>
<p>Write such a spell checker.</p>
<p>The first line of the input contains <span class="math-tex">\( d \)</span> – number of records in the list of known
    words. Next go <span class="math-tex">\( d \)</span> lines containing one known word per line, next — the number
    <span class="math-tex">\( l \)</span> of lines of the text, after which — <span class="math-tex">\( l \)</span>
    lines of the text.</p>
<p>Write a program that outputs those words from the text that are not found in the dictionary (i.e. erroneous). Your
    spell checker should be case insensitive. The words are entered in an arbitrary order. Words, which are not found in
    the dictionary, should not be duplicated in the output.</p>
